name: Trick Library Dependencies

# For more info and troubleshooting help for this workflow, see the Continuous Integration
# page in the GUNNS Wiki.
#
# We'd rather use a pre-built Docker image with the dependencies already installed, but we
# don't have a place to store the image.  We can't use the GiHhub Container Registry or
# Package containers, and don't want to use Docker Hub, so we have to configure the
# container from scratch each time.
