# Usage: . bashrc (source this file)
# This bashrc is designed to produce a bash environment that fully emulates the environment
# created by the cshrc that lives alongside it.  With this design, any changes to environment
# can be made to the cshrc, and they will automatically be applied to bash environments
#
# Limitations: the ? is used as a delimeter, which means if theres a ? anywhere in the env
# something is going to go wrong.  I tried multi-character delimiters (,,) but it still seemed
# to split on single ,'s. If multicharacter delims would work this problem would go away
